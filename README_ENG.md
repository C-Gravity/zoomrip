zoomrip is open source freeware for [Zoom](http://zoom.us/ "Zoom") meetings denial of service.

### What is this for?
Let's say, you have online lessons in Zoom, but you don't want to participate in them. This is what zoomrip is for. It will perform some actions to disconnect the clients in the meeting: creating many accounts and sending chat messages. Most of the devices will disconnect after this "DoS attack".

<h1 align="center">Installation üöÄ </h1>


1. Install Python 3.7+. This is how you do it:

    <h3>On Windows</h3>

    Download the installer from [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and launch it. Make sure you tick ![Add Python to PATH](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42045258/69171091-557d2780-0b0c-11ea-8adf-7f819357f041.png) when installing.
    
    <h3>On Linux</h3>

    There is a very good chance you already have Python 3 installed. If this is not the case, follow [the guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#linux).

2. Enter the following commands ([where?](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/7-ways-launch-command-prompt-windows-7-windows-8)):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/crinny/zoomrip
cd zoomrip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
